ServiceNOW CMDB Integration:

    Qualys intergration with ServiceNow CMDB helps security teams to gain
    comprehensive visibility into your IT asset inventory to immediately 
    flag security and compliance risks.
    
    ServiceNow is a third-party application that stores information about
    all technical services used in an enterprise in a Configuration 
    Management Database or CMDB. Within the CMDB, the support information for each 
    service offering is stored as Configuration Item specific to that service.
    This information includes service name and description, assignment groups, 
    change management approvers, and service roles. It also contains other information 
    directly related to the service support.
    
    Qualys offers a certified ServiceNow CMDB Sync App that supports 2-way
    integration, which means the metadata can move in both directions.
