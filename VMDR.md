Vulnerability Management Dectection and Response Life Cycle:

1 - Asset Management
    
    Here you will learn to identify and manage all assets throughout your
    business or enterprise architecture to protect your assets. This step is 
    also a part of the CIS Critical Contorls and NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
    
2 - Vulnerability Management:

    Here, you will be able to analyze the vulnerabilities findings for your
    enterprise assets.
    
3 - Threat Detection and Prioritization:

    Here yoou prioritize the vulnerability findings by the risk associated 
    with their known threats and other criteria.
    
4 - Response (Patch deployment):

    Here you can respond to the detected vulnerabilities and threats
    within days or even hours, rather than weeks or months.
    
CIS Critical Security Control 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets

Overview:

    Actively manage (inventory, track and correct) all enterprise assets 
    (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; network devices;
    non computing/Internet of Things (IoT) devices; and servers)
    connected to the infrastructure physically, virtually, remotely, 
    and those within cloud environments, to accurately know the totality
    of assets that need to be monotored and protected within the enterprise.
    This will also support identifying unauthorized and unmanaged assets to remove
    or remediate.
    
Qualys Sensor Platform:

1 - Remote Scanners:

    The Remote Scanners are internet-facing and ideal for scanning
    internet-facing assets around the globe.
    
2 - Local Scanners:

    Local Scanners are deployed on local area networks and commonly scan assets
    within reserved or private IP address ranges. These local scanners can be 
    deployed as physical or virtual appliances.
    
3 - Qualys Cloud Agents:

    Qualys Cloud Agents run as a local process on the host they
    protect. Qualys agents support a wide variety of OS platforms.
    
4 - Qualys Passive Sensors:

    Qualys Passive Sensors can be deployed as physical or virtual appliances.
    Working with TAPs and Switches throughout your network, passive sensors
    operate by sniffing network traffic sent to the Qualys platform for
    processing. Another essential benefit of Passive Sensor is helping
    you to identify the unmanaged assets throughout your network architecture.
    
5 - Cloud and SaaS Connectors:

    Cloud and SaaS Connectors work with the native services of your cloud and SaaS
    providers to identify misconfigurations and security blind spots. Cloud Connectors
    can be created for your AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure accounts. SaaS Connectors
    are available for Microsoft Office 365, Google Workspace, Zoom, and SalesForce.
    
6 - Qualys Container Sensor:

    Qualys Container Sensor downloads as a docker image and is installed on a docker
    host as a container application, right alongside other container applications.
    Once installed, Container Sensor will assess all new and existing Docker images and 
    containers for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    
7 - Out-of-band-Sensors:

    Out-of-band-Sensors help to secure devices on air-gapped netwroks.
    
8 - APIs:

    APIs collect data from third parties.
