Vulnerability Management Dectection and Response Life Cycle:

1 - Asset Management

    enterprise assets.
    
3 - Threat Detection and Prioritization:

    Here yoou prioritize the vulnerability findings by the risk associated 
    with their known threats and other criteria.
    
4 - Response (Patch deployment):

    Here you can respond to the detected vulnerabilities and threats
    within days or even hours, rather than weeks or months.
    
CIS Critical Security Control 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets

Overview:

    Actively manage (inventory, track and correct) all enterprise assets 
    (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; network devices;
    non computing/Internet of Things (IoT) devices; and servers)
    connected to the infrastructure physically, virtually, remotely, 
    and those within cloud environments, to accurately know the totality
    of assets that need to be monotored and protected within the enterprise.
    This will also support identifying unauthorized and unmanaged assets to remove
    or remediate.
